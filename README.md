This project is **strictly for educational purposes** and does **not contain any real malware**.

- The file named `infected` is **not harmful** ‚Äì it is a harmless executable that simply prints:
This file is infected,

# Virus Detector

A C program that detects and neutralizes binary viruses in ELF executables.  
Built as part of a systems programming lab using low-level Linux techniques, memory-safe code, and linked lists.

## üß† Features

- Reads virus signatures from a binary file (`signatures-B` or `signatures-L`)  
- Stores signatures in a linked list structure (`struct link`)
- Detects virus patterns in infected executable files using naive matching
- Neutralizes viruses by patching their code with a `RET` instruction
- Interactive menu-driven CLI interface
- Memory-safe (verified using Valgrind)

## üê≥ Running in 32-bit Linux using Docker

Replace `/full/path/to/virus-detector` with the actual path to your local folder:

```bash
$ docker run --platform linux/386 --privileged --name my-linux32 \
  -it -v "/full/path/to/virus-detector:/virus-detector" \
  ubuntu:18.04 bash

üõ†Ô∏è Inside the container:

$ apt update
$ apt install -y build-essential valgrind
$ cd /virus-detector
```

## üí° Example Run

```bash

$ chmod u+x infected
$ ./infected

This file is infected,
I am virus1!
Clean me, Please!

$ make
$ ./AntiVirus infected
